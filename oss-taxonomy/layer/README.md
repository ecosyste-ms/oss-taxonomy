# Layer

This facet describes **where in the software stack** the project sits or operates.

Examples:
- `frontend`: Code that runs in the browser or UI layer
- `backend`: Server-side logic or APIs
- `data-layer`: Storage, querying, or data processing
- `infrastructure`: Provisioning, orchestration, or underlying platform
- `platform`: Foundational services or environments that other software runs on

Each YAML file in this folder defines one layer. Explain its typical responsibilities and examples of tools that fit there.
